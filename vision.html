Satyalok...<br>
'Satyalok' literally means "The truthful divine place to live" or "A place where truthful divine people live". If we are to declare our group/organization/website motto in one sentence, we can conclude, "let's make this world a little more better place to live". We believe - "It's never too late to start a good step towards goodness".<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   In 2017 World Economic Forum conducted a survey on the topic  'Top 10 most concerning issue of the world' based on questions asked to more than 31,000 people of 18 to 35 years age across 186 countries. The issues and their percentage were as follows--<br>
</H3> <h5>&nbsp; &nbsp;      (1) Climate Change/Distribution of Nature(48.8℅)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;      (2) Large Scale Conflicts/Wars.(38.9℅)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;      (3) Inequality-  (Income,Discrimination) (30.8℅)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;      (4) Poverty (29.2℅)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;      (5) Religious Conflicts (23.9℅)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;      (6) Government Accountability and Transparency/Corruption (22.7℅)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;      (7) Food and Water Security (18.2℅).  <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;      (8) Lack of Education (15.9℅)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;      (9) Safety/Security/Well-being (14.1℅)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;      (10) Lack of Economic Opportunity and Employment (12.1℅)<br></h5><h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                     The percentage of these issues may vary according to place, people and their concern. But no doubt the above mentioned issues are most common threats in our present as well as for our future. I have given the above data only to show everyone here that if we really want a more better world, we have to work on every possible ways to resolve all the above mentioned problems or issues.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;               You may think, 'Is it practically possible ?' Then, with full of my faith I have to say, " All the problems of the world are the product of our thinking process guided by our negetive emotions. So, it is very clear that if our brain can create the problems than it has also the capabilities to resolve them."<br>
